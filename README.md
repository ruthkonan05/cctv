# üöÄ Smart Detection System using Sensors
## üìå Project Overview
The Smart Detection System using Sensors is a project designed to identify specific individuals by analyzing 
their movement patterns using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and a Machine Learning model (LSTM).

This system is designed for use in an office to distinguish between the owner and visitors. It relies on a Raspberry 
Pi, which collects the data and sends it to an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## üéØ Project Goals
‚úÖ Design a sensor-based detection system
‚úÖ Use artificial intelligence to identify individuals
‚úÖ Store and analyze real-time data with MongoDB
‚úÖ Provide a visual interface for tracking results

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### Hardware: Raspberry Pi, HC-SR04 Sensor
### Development: Python (Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy)
### Database: MongoDB
### Machine Learning: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks
### Dashboard: Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection

An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) detects movements in the room
The Raspberry Pi records the data and sends it to MongoDB
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Identification

An LSTM neural network model analyzes the movement data
It distinguishes the owner of the office from visitors
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization

Results are displayed on an interactive dashboard
The user can view presence and identification statistics
üìä Use Cases
üîπ Office or restricted space monitoring
üîπ Automatic identification of individuals based on their movements



# README - Advanced Person Detection System

## Project Overview

In the second semester, we improved our initial project by integrating a camera to enhance person detection. Additionally, we developed a mobile application using Flutter, which sent alerts upon detecting a person and displayed information about lab members. If an unknown person was detected, their information was also shown.

## Technologies & Components Used

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Continued use for movement detection.

Camera: Added for visual recognition of detected individuals.

OpenCV (Python Library): Used for face detection and recognition.

Raspberry Pi: Used for processing sensor and camera data.

MongoDB: Real-time database for storing detected individuals.

Flutter (Mobile App): Developed to send alerts and display information.

Notification System: Sends alerts when a person is detected.

Implementation Details

Person Detection:

The HC-SR04 sensor and camera work together to detect movement and capture images.

OpenCV processes the images to recognize known individuals.

### Real-Time Alert System:

If a person is detected, their data is stored in MongoDB.

The Flutter app receives a notification with the detected person's details.

If the person is unknown, their image is displayed in the app.

### Mobile Application:

Built with Flutter to allow real-time monitoring.

Displays lab members and unknown individuals.

Sends notifications when someone enters the monitored area.

Goals Achieved

Integrated camera-based detection using OpenCV.

Developed a mobile application for real-time alerts.

Implemented real-time notifications with person information.


How to Use

Connect the camera and HC-SR04 sensor to the Raspberry Pi.

Run the detection script to start person recognition.

Open the Flutter mobile app to receive notifications.

Train the face recognition model for improved accuracy.
